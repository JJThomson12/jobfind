## üóÇÔ∏è Storage Bucket Setup

### 1. Create Storage Buckets
In your Supabase dashboard, go to Storage and create the following buckets:

#### Profile Photos Bucket
- **Bucket Name**: `profile`
- **Public**: `true`
- **File Size Limit**: `5MB`
- **Allowed MIME Types**: `image/*`

#### Company/Job Images Bucket
- **Bucket Name**: `company`
- **Public**: `true`
- **File Size Limit**: `10MB`
- **Allowed MIME Types**: `image/*`

### 2. Storage Policies

#### Profile Photos Policies
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload profile images
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'profile');

-- Allow anyone to view profile images
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'profile');

-- Allow authenticated users to update their images
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update images"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'profile');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their images
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'profile');
```

#### Company Images Policies
```sql
-- Allow admins to upload company photos
CREATE POLICY "Admin can upload company photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'company');

-- Allow anyone to view company photos
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view company photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'company');
```

## üîê Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

Enable RLS on all tables and add the following policies:

### Users Table Policies
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can read their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
ON users FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
ON users FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Job Seekers Table Policies
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE job_seekers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can read their own job seeker data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own job seeker data"
ON job_seekers FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own job seeker data
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own job seeker data"
ON job_seekers FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can insert their own job seeker data
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own job seeker data"
ON job_seekers FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Jobs Table Policies
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE jobs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Anyone can view jobs
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view jobs"
ON jobs FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);

-- Only admins can insert jobs
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can insert jobs"
ON jobs FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
    AND users.role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Only job creators can update/delete jobs
CREATE POLICY "Job creators can update jobs"
ON jobs FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Job creators can delete jobs"
ON jobs FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Applications Table Policies
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE applications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Job seekers can view their own applications
CREATE POLICY "Job seekers can view own applications"
ON applications FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  job_seeker_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM job_seekers WHERE id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Job seekers can insert their own applications
CREATE POLICY "Job seekers can insert applications"
ON applications FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  job_seeker_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM job_seekers WHERE id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Job seekers can update their own applications (for soft delete)
CREATE POLICY "Job seekers can update own applications"
ON applications FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  job_seeker_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM job_seekers WHERE id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Admins can view all applications
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all applications"
ON applications FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
    AND users.role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Admins can update application status
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update applications"
ON applications FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users 
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
    AND users.role = 'admin'
  )
);
```
